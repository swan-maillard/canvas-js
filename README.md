# Canvas-JS Projects

## Description

Welcome to the **Canvas-JS Projects**! This repository encompasses various interactive visualizations and simulations built using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. Each subproject offers a perspective on different concepts that I am exploring, such as physics simulations, voting systems, and dynamic visual representations.

The Canvas-JS projects leverage the capabilities of the HTML5 `<canvas>` element to create engaging and interactive visualizations, so make sure you are using an up-to-date version of a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).

## Subprojects

### Bielle: [View on website](https://swan-maillard.github.io/canvas-js/bielle.html)

The Bielle project simulates the dynamics of a bielle mechanism, demonstrating rotational movements of connected solid shapes. Users can interact with the mechanism, observing how changes in parameters affect the motion.

### Liquid: [View on website](https://swan-maillard.github.io/canvas-js/liquid.html)

The Liquid project is an attempt to simulate liquid/slimy particles.

### Magnet: [View on website](https://swan-maillard.github.io/canvas-js/magnet.html)

The Magnet project simulates nodes that are attracted by the mouse. Each node moves smoothly, returning to its original position when not influenced by the mouse, resembling magnetic behavior.

### Nappe: [View on website](https://swan-maillard.github.io/canvas-js/nappe.html)

Nappe is an attempt to simulate fabric behavior using a grid of nodes linked by springs and influenced by gravity. It allows the user to create and manipulate the network of nodes, by locking a node in place (not influenced by gravity) or adding links between any nodes. When running the simulation, the user can cut the links.

### Robot: [View on website](https://swan-maillard.github.io/canvas-js/robot.html)

The Robot project simulates a robotic arm with multiple joints. Users can interact with the robot by adjusting sliders that control joint angles and distances between each angle. A step-by-step animation showcases the use of each parameter.

### Strabulin: [View on website](https://swan-maillard.github.io/canvas-js/strabulin.html)

Strabulin is a very friendly guy who likes staring at the mouse!

### Voting: [View on website](https://swan-maillard.github.io/canvas-js/voting.html)

The Voting simulation demonstrates a voting system using different voting strategies (majoritarian and approval voting), based on voters' distance to candidates. Users can move candidates on the political plan, choose if poll results influence the voters, and observe the election outcome in real time.
