# Canvas-JS Projects

## Description

Welcome to the **Canvas-JS Projects**! This repository encompasses various interactive visualizations and simulations built using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. Each subproject offers a perspective on different concepts that I am exploring such as physics simulations, voting systems, and dynamic visual representations.
The Canvas-JS projects leverages the capabilities of the HTML5 `<canvas>` element to create engaging and interactive visualizations.

## Subprojects

### Nappe: https://swan-maillard.github.io/canvas-js/nappe.html

**File:** `nappe.js`

Nappe is a simulation of a node-link structure that behaves like a grid of nodes influenced by gravity and user interactions. It allows users to create and manipulate a network of nodes, with links that can be added or removed based on user input.

**Key Features:**
- Lock and connect nodes by clicking and dragging.
- Gravity influences the motion of nodes.
- Cut the links whilte the simulation is running

### Bielle: https://swan-maillard.github.io/canvas-js/bielle.html

**File:** `bielle.js`

The Bielle project simulates the dynamics of a bielle mechanism, demonstrating rotational movements of connected solid shapes. Users can interact with the mechanism, observing how changes in parameters affect the motion.

**Key Features:**
- Visual representation of rotational movements.

### Magnet: https://swan-maillard.github.io/canvas-js/magnet.html

**File:** `magnet.js`

The Magnet project simulates nodes that are attracted or repelled by the mouse position. Each node moves smoothly, returning to its original position when not influenced by the mouse. This creates a visually appealing interaction pattern that resembles magnetic behavior.

**Key Features:**
- Nodes respond to mouse movement.
- Attractive and repulsive forces create smooth animations.

### Voting: https://swan-maillard.github.io/canvas-js/voting.html

**File:** `voting.js`

The Voting simulation demonstrates a voting system using different voting strategies (majoritarian and approval voting). Users can interact with candidates, simulate voters with preferences, and observe the election outcome based on the chosen voting system.

**Key Features:**
- Multiple voting systems available for selection.
- Simulation of voter behavior based on distance to candidates.
- Real-time visual representation of election results.
