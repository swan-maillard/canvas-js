# Canvas-JS Projects

## Description

Welcome to the **Canvas-JS Projects**! This repository encompasses various interactive visualizations and simulations built using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. Each subproject offers a perspective on different concepts that I am exploring, such as physics simulations, voting systems, and dynamic visual representations.

The Canvas-JS projects leverage the capabilities of the HTML5 `<canvas>` element to create engaging and interactive visualizations, so make sure you are using an up-to-date version of a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).

## Subprojects

### Connected rods animation

This project simulates the dynamics of a connected rods mechanism, demonstrating rotational movements of connected solid shapes. Users can interact with the mechanism, observing how changes in parameters affect the motion.

### Slimey liquid animation

This project is an attempt to animate liquid/slimy looking particles.

### Repulsive magnetic mouse

This project simulates particles that are repelled by the mouse. Each particle returns to its original position when not influenced by the mouse, resembling magnetic behavior.

### Fabric simulation

This project is an attempt to simulate fabric behavior using a grid of nodes linked by springs and influenced by gravity. It allows the user to create and manipulate the network of nodes, by locking a node in place (not influenced by gravity) and adding links between the nodes. When running the simulation, the user can cut the links, simulating the fabric being cut off and falling.

### Robotic arm animation

This project simulates a robotic arm with multiple joints. The user can interact with the robot by adjusting sliders that control joint angles and distances between each angle. A step-by-step animation showcases the use of each parameter.

### Strabulin

Strabulin is a friendly character very intrigued by the mouse!

### Voting system simulation

This project demonstrates a voting system using different voting strategies (majoritarian and approval voting), based on voters' distance to candidates. The user can move candidates on the political axis, choose if poll results influence the voters, and observe the election outcome in real time.
